![Francisco's profile pic]({{ site.url }}/images/profile-pic.jpg)

Here a frontend developer with a design background — which basically means I may care too much about pixels and user experience, and I'm not too sorry about that.

I started tinkering with websites back in 2010, doing web design and WordPress projects, later leveling up my frontend skills and beginning work on actual software UIs for serious business apps.

I'm passionate about interfaces and love building things that feel polished, intuitive and pleasant. 
I value clear communication, warm connections and getting things done without the corporate fluff.

If you need someone who bridges design thinking and solid code and who doesn't want meetings longer than they need to be, let's talk? Just please <a href='mailto:franciscopauloferreira@gmail.com'>email me</a>.
