Here a frontend developer with a design background — which basically means I may care too much about pixels and user experience, and I'm not too sorry about that.

I started tinkering with websites back in 2010, doing web design and WordPress projects. Then, some life happened, I leveled up my frontend skills and began working on actual software UIs for serious business apps. The kind of stuff that needs to work well and look good doing it.

I'm passionate about interfaces and love building things that feel polished and intuitive. 
I value clear communication, warm teams, and getting things done without the corporate fluff.

If you need someone who bridges design thinking and solid code, and who won't make meetings longer than they need to be, let's talk? Just please <a href='mailto:franciscopauloferreira@gmail.com'>email me</a>.
