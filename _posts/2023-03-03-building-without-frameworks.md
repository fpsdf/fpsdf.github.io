title: "Building without frameworks: pure HTML/CSS/JS feels good sometimes"
---

You know that moment when you're setting up a project and suddenly you’re not building something — you’re configuring something?

Tooling, build steps, plugins, dependencies, modules, bundlers… before you’ve written a single line of real code, you’ve already been through a small bureaucratic hell.

That’s when I sometimes just open a folder, drop in an `index.html`, a `style.css`, and a `script.js`, and go: *ahhh*. No build, no deploy pipeline, no dependencies yelling at me because Node updated. Just a browser and some basic files.

There’s something really nice — maybe even grounding — about building a small project without any frameworks. No React, no Vue, no nothing. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, like it’s 2007 (but in a good way).

I recently built a tiny little tool this way (I'll share it here soon), and it reminded me that simplicity can be a feature, not a limitation. It loads fast. It works offline. There’s no client-side routing to debug. And I can deploy it anywhere in seconds — GitHub Pages, a zip file, whatever.

Don’t get me wrong: I love modern tools. I see the power of components, state, all that good stuff. But sometimes, stripping things back reminds me *why* I like to build things in the first place.

No tool between me and the idea.
