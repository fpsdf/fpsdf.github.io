*(say 'bitch be cool!' say 'bitch be cool!')*

I can't do one thing at a time. Never could.

Right now I'm:
- Job hunting (sending CVs, portfolio updates)
- Learning something new (always)
- Fixing stuff around the house
- Dealing with bureaucracy (insurance or whatever)
- Five other things

My brain doesn't do linear. It does parallel chaos.

#### brain dump lists

The only thing that helps and always did, always will: listing it all down. But I mean everything, like things to do, things you want to ruminate about, concerns. Everything.

- That one scene from the movie I just saw yesterday
- That thing I want to ask to my buddy next time I see him
- Fix that bug in the side project
- Reply to that email from 3 days ago
- Figure out what that weird noise in the bike is
- Update LinkedIn maybe
- That other thing I'm forgetting but will remember in a second

Doesn't matter what. Just get it out of my head.

#### it creates space

Once it's written down, my brain stops trying to remember it all. I can actually focus on one thing for a bit without that background noise.

Do I follow the list perfectly? No, that's not the point. Do things still pile up? Yes. But at least it's not spinning in my head at 1am.

#### Maybe it's ADHD, 

maybe it's just how I work. Either way, I feel I'm not changing.
