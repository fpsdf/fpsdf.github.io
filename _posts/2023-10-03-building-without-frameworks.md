title: "building without frameworks"

Last week I spent 40 minutes fighting with Vite config. Not building anything, just trying to make the fucking thing start.

So I said screw it and made a folder with index.html, style.css, script.js. Double-click the HTML. Done.

Forgot how nice this is. No build step. No watching. No "module not found" because I breathed wrong. Just refresh the browser.

Built a small thing this way (might share it, might not). Deployed it by dragging the folder to Vercel. Took 10 seconds.

I'm not saying frameworks are bad—I use Angular at work and it's fine for big stuff. But sometimes you just want to make a button do something without installing 200 packages first.

Also there's something satisfying about view source actually showing you the code instead of 5MB of webpack runtime.
