title: "building without frameworks"
layout: post

tooling, build steps, plugins, dependencies, modules, bundlers… before you’ve written a single line of real code, you’ve already been through a small bureaucratic hell.

that’s when I sometimes just open a folder, drop in an `index.html`, a `style.css` and a `script.js`, and go: _ahhh_. no build, no deploy pipeline, no dependencies yelling at me because Node updated. just a browser and some basic files.

there’s something really nice or maybe even grounding about building a small project without any frameworks. just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript like it’s 2004.

I recently built a tiny little project this way (I'll share it here soon. or maybe never), and it reminded me that simplicity can be a feature. it loads fast. it works offline. no client-side routing to debug. and I can deploy it anywhere in seconds — GitHub Pages, a zip file, whatever.

I love modern tools. I see the power of components, state, all the good stuff. but sometimes, stripping things back reminds me _why_ I like to build things in the first place.
