So I had this idea: what if AI analyzed every vehicle in the city, tracked movements (using hashed plates for GDPR or whatever), and optimized everything?

- Reroute street directions based on actual flow
- Sync traffic lights properly
- Redesign bus routes and schedules with real data
- Suggest new bike lanes where they'd actually help

Data-driven urbanism and no more guessing :)))

#### well,

Cities have been doing versions of this for years with sensors, cameras, GPS data from buses, phone location data... Singapore, Barcelona, to name a couple.

And, I shit you not, it wasn't a solution.

#### why doesn't it work?

The real problem isn't technical:

- Change street directions, shop owners riot
- Syncing traffic lights works great for one route, screws the other
- Redesigning bus routes brings no consent
- Suggest fewer parking spots: political suicide

The actual solution is obvious: fewer cars, which nobody wants to hear.

#### induced demand

Even if we could magically optimize everything without political burden, we'd hit another wall: induced demand.

Make traffic flow better makes more people drive which makes congestion return to the same level.

It's like adding another lane to a highway. Feels great for a bit, then it's just as jammed as before because everyone who was avoiding that route now uses it.

#### so what's the point?

Maybe the point is that this isn't a problem we can tech-moonwalk our way out of. The optimal traffic system probably's not an algorithm and is more like "ban half the cars".

:))) But heyyy! Good luck selling that to anyone.
