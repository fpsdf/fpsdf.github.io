*(swear this ain't me)*

I've had a standing desk since around 2016, an IKEA SKARSTA (the manual crank one). Cranking that thing up and down is a bit of a workout, not gonna lie. Cost me something like €150 back then.

Here's the thing: I've never convinced anyone to get a standing desk. Not a single person. So take this with a grain of salt.

#### why most people quit

The first few days I was like "uh...". The whole thing felt like hit and miss. Turns out the desk and monitor heights were just wrong.

Get the desk so your elbows are at 90 degrees when typing. Monitor top should be at eye level. Sounds obvious but it's easy to fuck up. Once I fixed that, it actually worked forever.

#### right right, but what's, like, the point?

The tiredness is different. After a day standing, I'm physically tired but not that dead, compressed feeling from sitting all day. It's cleaner somehow, like you actually did something instead of just existing in a chair.

And you're not stuck. If I want some coffee, I'm already standing. If I want to pace around while thinking, I'm good to go. There's no "ok time to get up" moment because you're already up.

#### should you do it?

I still encourage everyone to try it. It works for me, it might not work for you. If you do try it, just get the heights right from day one and give it a few weeks before deciding.
