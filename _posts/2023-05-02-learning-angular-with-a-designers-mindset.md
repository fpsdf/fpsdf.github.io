title: "learning Angular (sorta backwards)"

I learned Angular backwards. Most people start with TypeScript concepts and architecture. I started by fiddling around with buttons and trying to make things look right.

Came from doing design stuff, so my brain thinks in screens and flows, not in "how should this be architected." Felt like a disadvantage at first.

Then I realized components are just the boxes I was already drawing. A card is a card. A button is a button. Angular just makes them reusable and gives them inputs/outputs.

What actually helped:

- Drew the UI first (sometimes on paper like a caveman), then built components that matched
- Named things the same in code as I would in Figma—if it's a PrimaryButton in the design, it's PrimaryButton in the code
- Treated components like design system pieces: here's the thing, here's what you can customize, done

RxJS still makes no sense half the time but whatever, that's what StackOverflow is for.

The framework clicked when I stopped trying to learn it "properly" and just built stuff the way that made sense to me.
